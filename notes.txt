Dojo Weather Forecast
Create an app which presents the user with 6 different views (using the router-outlet) 
Each different url/view should present the user with a Dojo city. 
Within each of these views, present the user with the current weather information. 
Additionally, show an image of each of the cities, you can use https://www.pexels.com/ for royalty free images.

This assignment will require you to retrieve an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api

Use the following URL pattern for each city:

Default (root) url - 'http://localhost:4200/' should immediately redirect us to your local Dojo url. 
Seattle, WA - 'http://localhost:4200/seattle'
San Jose, CA - 'http://localhost:4200/sanjose'
Burbank, CA - 'http://localhost:4200/burbank'
Dallas, TX - 'http://localhost:4200/dallas'
Washington D.C. - 'http://localhost:4200/dc'
Chicago, IL - 'http://localhost:4200/chicago'

Each city is its own component
when compoent loads: 
1)retrieve promise from a service and update itself with the new data from the api call.
2)the service needs to make the api calls and returns the promise to any component the invokes its methods

REMINDER: When building applications which include forms and http requests, be sure to import the 'FormsModule' and 'HttpModule' in your AppModule file (referenced in the 'Installation & CLI' chapter).
